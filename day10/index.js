// Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

const favorite_fruits = ["Apple", "Pears", "Orange"]

if (favorite_fruits.includes("Apple")){
    console.log(`You really love ${favorite_fruits[0]}`)

// Q30 - Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

// If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

// Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

const username = ['admin','lizzy','mabel','onyekah','faith']

username.forEach(function(element){
if(element == 'admin'){
    console.log(`Hello ${element}, would you like to see a status report?`)
} else {
