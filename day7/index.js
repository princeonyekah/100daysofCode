// Q19 - Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 14 through 18, print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

const guests = ["Joel", "Lola", "Pelumi", "Kay", "Jide"];
console.log(`I am inviting ${guests.length} people to dinner.`);

// Q20 - Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

var food_items = ["Cassava", "Garri", "Ewa", "Crayfish"];

// Join the food items into a comma-separated string
var message = `I would love to eat ${food_items.join(", ")}`;
console.log(message);

// Q21 - Then think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
